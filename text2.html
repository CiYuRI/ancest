    <h1>The PDP-10: Alan Kotok</h1>
    <h2>Alan Kotok was the lead architect and designer of the PDP-10. Born on November 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was one of the most recognizable human ambassadors of computers.</h2>
    <h2>Kotok is considered one of the fathers of video games, computational games that humans enjoyed in leisure, playing a part in the creation of Spacewar! by giving Steve (Slug) Russell the sine-cosine routine needed to complete the game.</h2>
    <h2>Kotok was also one of the founders of the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that created standards for the internet, which further shifted humanity towards digitalization.</h2>
