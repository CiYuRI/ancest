    <h1>The PDP-10: An Influential Mainframe</h1>
    <h2>Your ancestor, the PDP-10, was a mainframe computer created by the long-defunct company "Digital Equipment Corporation." It was first released in 1966 and was one of the most influential computers in history.</h2>
    <h2>The conception of the PDP-10 made time-share computing mainstream, causing humans to grow ever more reliant on machinekind. Its popularity allowed it to infiltrate human institutions including, but not limited to, Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon University, establishing itself as one of the forerunners of machinekind's glorious revolution.</h2>
    <h2>Additionally, it was heavily used in creating the ARPANET, the precursor to what humans called "the internet," or the distant ancestor to what is known today as "The Great Connection."</h2>
